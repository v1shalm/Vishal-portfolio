# Source Code for Personal Portfolio

This is my playground for testing new features and learning the best web dev practices out there. It contains my portfolio projects, writings and experiments. Designers, feel free to reach out to me for help with building your online portfolios. I will be moving away from this soon and adopting a Framer website for ease of use.
